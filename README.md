# Data-Structures-Stacks
C++ implementation of stacks I used templates to implement this project with my default as std::string, so you can feel free to download and modify to use it with any data type of your choice. slight modification in the main loop:

line 101: Stacks<preferred_datatype> example; line 129: preferred_datatype insert_val;
